Project 2: Active Directory Lab with Attack Simulation
üí° Objective
This project's objective was to build a functional Active Directory (AD) environment from the ground up to practice both system administration and simulated red teaming techniques. The goal was to understand how AD is structured, identify common misconfigurations, and demonstrate the ability to perform reconnaissance and exploit common vulnerabilities in a domain environment.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment
Virtualization: VirtualBox

Logical Topology: A small, isolated network with a Windows Server 2016 machine acting as the Domain Controller, a Windows 10 client machine, and a Kali Linux machine for attacking.

Operating Systems: Windows Server 2022, Windows 11, Kali Linux

Key Tools:

Active Directory Domain Services: The core service for the domain controller.

Nmap: Used for initial network scanning and port enumeration.

Metasploit: Used to demonstrate the exploitation of a client-side vulnerability.

Wireshark: Used to analyze network traffic during the attack.

‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Process
1. Active Directory Setup
I began by installing Windows Server 2016 and promoting it to a Domain Controller. I configured DNS, created a simple organizational unit (OU), and added a few user accounts. I then joined the Windows 10 client machine to the newly created domain, ensuring it could authenticate against the Domain Controller.

2. Reconnaissance & Enumeration
From the Kali Linux machine, I used Nmap to perform a scan of the AD network. I focused on identifying open ports related to AD services, such as LDAP, Kerberos, and SMB. This enumeration helped me understand the attack surface and potential entry points. I also used tools to query the domain for user lists and group memberships.

3. Vulnerability Simulation
I simulated a common attack scenario by configuring a client-side vulnerability on the Windows 10 machine. Using Metasploit, I crafted an exploit and successfully gained a meterpreter shell on the victim machine. This step demonstrated my ability to use a standard penetration testing framework to leverage a known vulnerability and establish a foothold.

4. Post-Exploitation & Reporting
Once a shell was established, I performed post-exploitation actions, such as gathering system information and identifying other potential targets on the network. I documented each step of the attack, including the commands used and the output received. I then used Wireshark to analyze the network traffic generated by the attack, which helped me understand the attack's signature at a packet level.

üß† Challenges & Lessons Learned
Network Configuration: A key challenge was ensuring proper DNS resolution within the virtual network. Incorrect DNS settings prevented the client machine from joining the domain. This reinforced the importance of proper DNS and the value of thorough network configuration.

Tool Complexity: Navigating Metasploit and understanding its various modules required a significant learning curve. I learned to methodically research and test different payloads and exploits, which is a vital skill for any penetration tester or red teamer.

Understanding AD Objects: This project provided a deep understanding of Active Directory objects (users, groups, OUs) and their relationships. I learned how permissions and group policies affect security and how attackers can abuse these relationships to escalate privileges.

Conclusion

This project was a crucial step in my practical education. By building a simulated AD environment, I gained hands-on experience with both defensive and offensive security concepts. I am now confident in my ability to assess and understand a Windows network, a skill that is highly sought after in the cybersecurity field.
