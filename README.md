# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab
This repository documents my hands-on journey through a personal cybersecurity home lab, demonstrating a broad range of practical skills in a controlled environment. By completing the structured projects from projectsecurity.io, I have built a comprehensive portfolio of documented, real-world skills to support my career transition into cybersecurity.

üèÜ Final Achievement
All planned projects for the initial home lab curriculum have been successfully completed. This marks a major milestone in my skill development, transitioning from theoretical knowledge to practical application. The projects below represent a solid foundation in key cybersecurity domains, including network defense, red teaming, and log analysis.

üõ°Ô∏è Core Skills Demonstrated
Network Security: Implementing firewalls, configuring network segmentation, and analyzing traffic.

Threat Detection & Prevention: Deploying and managing Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).

Vulnerability Analysis: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

System Hardening: Securing operating systems and services to mitigate common attacks.

Incident Response: Responding to simulated security events and analyzing attack logs.

Log Management & Analysis: Ingesting and analyzing security event logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
This home lab is built using a variety of industry-standard and open-source tools to replicate a real-world network environment.

Virtualization: VMware Workstation

Operating Systems: Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, Metasploitable 2, Windows Server 2016

Security Tools: Suricata, Wireshark, Nmap, Scapy, Metasploit

Firewall: pfSense

SIEM: The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

üìÇ Project Portfolio
Each project below includes a detailed write-up covering the objective, environment setup, step-by-step process, and a reflection on challenges and lessons learned.
